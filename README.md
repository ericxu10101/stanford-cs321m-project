# IRT Parameter Drift Across LLM Generations and Architectures on Open LLM Leaderboard v2

CS321M Spring 2026 Final Project — Stanford

## 1. Overview

This project applies Item Response Theory (IRT) to analyze whether benchmark items on the Open LLM Leaderboard v2 (BBH, MATH-Hard, GPQA-Diamond, MuSR) maintain consistent psychometric properties across:
- **Temporal cohorts** of LLMs: Q2-2024, Q3-2024, Q4-2024, Q1-2025
- **Architecture families**: Gemma2, Llama, Mistral, Qwen2

We fit 2PL IRT models to extract per-item difficulty (b) and discrimination (a) parameters, then test whether these parameters drift as the population of evaluated models changes over time and across architectures.

> **Note:** The final paper reports results for BBH and MATH-Hard only. GPQA-Diamond and MuSR have only 3 subtask groups each — too few for reliable rank-order analysis. Their data and IRT fits are retained in this repo for exploratory use.

## 3. Environment Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+, pip

**Computation:** 8 GB RAM minimum; 16 GB recommended. No GPU required.

### 3.1 Install `torch_measure`

This project's IRT fitting depends on [`torch_measure`](http://torch-measure.readthedocs.io). Follow the installation guide at that link, then install the project's local extension:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3.2 Install remaining dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib statsmodels pyarrow jupyter
```

## 4. Public Data Download

All external data lives in `data_raw/`. Two sources are needed:

**1. Model metadata** — already included in this repo as `data_raw/models.parquet`.
Source: [`open-llm-leaderboard/contents`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/contents) on Hugging Face.

**2. Per-model benchmark results** — not included due to size (~several GB). Clone directly into `data_raw/`:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/contents data_raw/results
```

> The rest of the pipeline assumes `data_raw/results/` exists and is populated before running any notebook.

## 5. Reproducing Results via Notebooks

All notebooks are in `notebooks/`. Run them in the order below; each writes its outputs to the directory the next notebook reads from. Each notebook is self-documented — cells below the header explain parameters and expected outputs.

```bash
# Execute a notebook non-interactively (run from the project root)
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/<notebook>.ipynb
```

- `p0_population_stats.ipynb` *(optional)* — Exploratory analysis of model metadata in `data_raw/models.parquet`. Not required to reproduce paper results.
- `p1_data_collect.ipynb` — Preprocesses raw leaderboard results from `data_raw/`; outputs cleaned score matrices to `data_raw_clean/`.
- `p2_irt_pipe.ipynb` — Core IRT fitting pipeline. Fits 2PL models per cohort and architecture family; outputs parameter CSVs to `data_irt/`. (IRT fitting uses results may vary slightly across hardware.)
- `p3_post_analysis.ipynb` — Full analysis and figure generation. Reproduces all statistics and figures in the paper. (The `data_irt/` CSVs are the exact inputs to `p3_post_analysis.ipynb`; figures can be regenerated without re-running IRT.)
